In this section I focus on topics for technical leadership (Staff Data Scientist, Staff Machine Learning Engineer).

In the last couple of years, I've been interesed as a people manager on how support this profile in my teams, identify when and how I need them in my teams, and even to play it by myself when possible and needed.

More specifically, I wanted to develop people beyond that first step into technical leadership, which consists of leading implementation and mentoring junior and senior.

In 2023, I teamed up with my team's Staff Machine Learning Engineer, [Caique Lima](https://www.linkedin.com/in/caiquelima), and prepared a couple of workshops for the Lead Machine Learning Engineers we had in our Org. Beyond our own experience, they were based on three books: Team Topologies [^fn1], The Staff Engineer's Path [^fn2], and the Staff engineer: leadership beyond the management track [^fn3].

I will share a revised version of it and keep adding as I learn from the trajectories of professionals on this track.
