The people section is composed by topics. Here's a suggestion on how to consume.

The [One on one](https://datascienceleadership.com/docs/people-management/one-on-one-guide) is probably the first thing a report will expect. Then, understand how your company sees the Data Science career and where your reports are on it using the [Career ladder](https://datascienceleadership.com/docs/people-management/career-ladder).

Now you understand better the general expectations about you and your team, use the [expectation setting](https://datascienceleadership.com/docs/people-management/manager-report-expectations-doc) to provide clarity.

If you have someone developing to become a technical leader, see [From Sr. to Lead](https://datascienceleadership.com/docs/people-management/from-sr-to-lead).
If you are hiring people for the first time, check [the role of the hiring manager](https://datascienceleadership.com/docs/people-management/hiring-manager-role) and [defining a starter project](https://datascienceleadership.com/docs/people-management/starter-project).
If you are managing other managers and you need to foster a community of good people managers, see the [Continuous calibration](https://datascienceleadership.com/docs/people-management/continuous-performance-calibration).

## References for new managers

There are great books on management that can serve as a base for Data Science and ML Engineering people managers.

[The Manager's Path](https://www.amazon.com/Managers-Path-Leaders-Navigating-Growth/dp/1491973897) by Camille Fournier: it covers the whole management career for Engineering, which serves very well for Data Science; From first position as a manager to VP.

[Radical Candor](https://www.amazon.com/Radical-Candor-Revised-Kick-Ass-Humanity/dp/B07XVQB7XV?crid=1J2P1D9I5AVGV&keywords=radical+candor&qid=1695127014&s=books&sprefix=radical+candor,stripbooks-intl-ship,204&sr=1-1) by Kim Scott: it focus on the feedback and the relationship with the reports. Feedback is commonly the top 3 thing people will expect from their manager, and this book provides a great perspective about it.
