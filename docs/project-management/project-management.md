# Introduction

A couple of years ago, I moved in my job from the most experienced team on building solutions with Machine Learning to a team eager to have its first wave of models.

We, the "Data Science people", did a brief document about the model and explained it to the team in a meeting. Soon, we started grabbing the data and fitting some models. After we provided the first results - still as model metrics, someone cheered in a team retrospective: "We are close to having ML models!". I had to adjust the expectations, and we agreed to clarify the project scope for the team.

The Product Manager set a meeting with everybody, so we could write a PRD (Product Requirements Document) to define the project scope. Then I had this great revelation. I was amazed by how different ideas people had about what we would build. That was one of the best things I could have been exposed to learn about the importance of shared understanding.

After a confusing hour, I approached an Agilist to get some help. He recommended to me Jeff Patton's User Story Mapping book [^fn1]. The book is excellent. As I applied it to Data Science projects, I could identify the key parts of it for the field and develop others with the team.

In this post, I'll share my current approach regarding Project Management for Data Science. I'll try to keep it reasonably short and write other posts if this content is useful for the community.

To illustrate it, the recurrent example will use a Delivery company that wants to boost its referral program by offering discount coupons to customers and nudging them to invite someone to join the platform.
